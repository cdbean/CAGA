<!--

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how to configure a locally installed Microsoft speech recognizer
for use with relevant tools included in the Microsoft Speech Platform SDK.

In this example, the configuration file specifies several optional properties that can be set on
the recognizer.

As an important reminder, in order to configure a local engine, you must have installed both the
Speech runtime in addition to a runtime language (i.e., language pack or specific language engine).

-->


<Configuration>

  <!-- Indicates that the recognizer is installed locally -->
  <Provider type="local" />

  <!-- Only the 'enginerequiredattributes' values are required; all others are optional -->
  <Properties
     completetimeout="0.25s" incompletetimeout="3s"
     maxnbest="4" requesttimeout="15s" enginerequiredattributes="Language=409;Vendor=Microsoft"
     engineoptionalattributes="CommandAndControl">
  </Properties>

</Configuration>
